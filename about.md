I am a PhD researcher at TU Eindhoven, the Netherlands. My current research focuses on automatic differentiation variational inference and how to incorporate it into message passing in factor graphs. Among my research interests are time series models, relational learning with matrix and tensor factorizations, mixture models and topic models. In my previous research projects and jobs, I've developed machine learning models for a broad range of application areas including text understanding, social media analysis, and automatic trading in stock market.
