This is the first post I am creating in Github pages. In this page, I am planning to blog about the topics I am studying and these blogs will be mostly about machine learning and fields which are related with machine learning like probabilistic models, deep learning, natural language processing, and computer vision.

There is a superb guide on how to create github pages easily and you can access it from [here.](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/)
